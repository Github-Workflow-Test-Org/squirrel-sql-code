<P><B>Scope</B></P>
<P>This article explains how to set up
Java-IDEs to develop and debug SQuirreL and SQuirreL-Plugins. The set
up presented here is different from the standard Maven
based set up explained at
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/squirrel-sql/wiki/DeveloperGuide">http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/squirrel-sql/wiki/DeveloperGuide</A>.
While the Maven based set up provides all the necessary steps to
create full builds and installers for SQuirreL this set up is focused on a
programmer's needs who wants to quickly compile, test and
debug code changes.</P>

	<LI><P><B>Basic idea</B><BR>First we
	describe the basic idea of the set up which should be
	IDE-independent. That means with any Java-IDE one should be able to
	create a project according to the basic idea.</P>

	<LI><P>Install SQuirreL in some
	directory. Alternatively after you have done the Maven builds you
	might use <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">sql12/installer/squirrelsql-other-installer/target/
	</SPAN>as your quasi installation directory.</P>
	<LI><P>Create a project in your IDE and
	include the necessary libraries from the installation directory.
	That is usually the jars from the lib dir, squirrel-sql.jar and the
	jars from the plugins/ directory. <BR>
	Some Plugins bring their own
	libraries with them. You might need to include those libs in your
	project too.</P>
	<LI><P>At this point you should be able
	to start SQuirrel from within the IDE using 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.Main
		as main class. 
		</P>
		<LI><P>splash:&lt;install-dir&gt;/icons/splash.jpg
		as VM parameter. (Note: You wont find splash.jpg in the quasi
		installation dir mentioned above.)</P>
		<LI><P>-home &lt;installation-directory&gt;
		as program parameter.</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P>Include the sources of your SVN
	checkout you want to work with in your project. For example<BR>
	sql12/fw/src/main/java/ <BR>
	sql12/fw/src/main/resource/<BR>
	sql12/app/src/main/java/<BR>
	sql12/app/src/main/resource/ <BR>
	sql12/plugins/graph/src/main/java/<BR>
	sql12/plugins/graph/src/main/resource/ 
	</P>
</OL>

Now you should be able to compile,
test and debug code changes to these sources. This works because
your IDE usually has a compile output directory. When you launch
SQuirreL from within your IDE this directory should automatically be
put first in your classpath.<BR><BR>
