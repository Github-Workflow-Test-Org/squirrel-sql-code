Multiple Source Plugin
----------------------

Allows users to write one SQL query that spans multiple databases.

This plugin requires UnityJDBC driver to run.  A full-feature, free-to-distribute
version of the driver is included with the plugin.  The only limitation of the
driver is the number of results is limited to 100.

More information on the driver can be found at www.unityjdbc.com.
